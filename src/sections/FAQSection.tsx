    category: "Assembly & Setup",
    question: "How long does it take to assemble the BBQ Grill?",
    answer: "Most of our standard commercial BBQ grills come 90% pre-assembled. Final setup typically takes 15-20 minutes and requires only basic tools which are included in the package."
  },
  {
    category: "Assembly & Setup",
    question: "Do I need a professional technician for installation?",
    answer: "For standalone units like rocket stoves and portable grills, no professional help is needed. For large-scale multi-unit commercial kitchen installations, we recommend using our certified installation partners to ensure proper ventilation and safety compliance."
  },
  {
    category: "Fast & Cooking",
    question: "How fast does the Rocket Stove heat up?",
    answer: "Thanks to our patented insulated combustion chamber, the KitchenBots Rocket Stove reaching cooking temperatures in under 2 minutes using 40% less fuel than traditional wood stoves."
  },
  {
    category: "Fast & Cooking",
    question: "Can I use both charcoal and wood in the BBQ grills?",
    answer: "Yes, our heavy-duty steel grills are engineered to handle both charcoal and firewood. The high-grade stainless steel interior prevents warping even under intense dual-fuel heat."
  },
  {
    category: "Cleaning & Care",
    question: "How do I clean the stainless steel surfaces?",
    answer: "Use warm soapy water and a soft cloth for regular cleaning. For tough grease, a commercial-grade stainless steel cleaner or a mixture of vinegar and baking soda works best. Avoid using steel wool as it can scratch the finish."
  },
  {
    category: "Cleaning & Care",
    question: "Is the equipment rust-proof for outdoor use?",
    answer: "We use high-grade 304 stainless steel and weather-resistant powder coating. While highly resistant to rust, we recommend using a protective cover when the equipment is not in use for extended periods, especially during monsoon season."
  },
  {
    category: "Delivery & Shipping",
    question: "How is the equipment packaged for shipping?",
    answer: "All industrial units are shipped in high-impact wooden crates with internal shock-absorbing foam. This ensures your equipment arrives in perfect condition even during long-distance transit across India."
  },
  {
    category: "Delivery & Shipping",
    question: "What are the shipping charges for bulk orders?",
    answer: "Shipping is FREE for orders above ₹10,000. For bulk wholesale orders (20+ units), we provide discounted freight rates through our dedicated logistics partners."
  },
  {
    category: "Warranty & Returns",
    question: "What does the 12-month warranty cover?",
    answer: "The warranty covers all manufacturing defects and structural failures under normal operating conditions. It includes repair or replacement of defective parts. Consumable items like grill grates have a 6-month limited wear warranty."
  },
  {
    category: "Warranty & Returns",
    question: "Can I return the product if I'm not satisfied?",
    answer: "We offer a 7-day inspection period for unused equipment. If the product doesn't meet your business requirements, you can return it in its original packaging for a full refund (minus return shipping costs)."
  },
  {
    category: "Orders & Wholesale",
    question: "How do I place a wholesale order?",
    answer: "Wholesale pricing kicks in at 20 units. You can click the 'Get Bulk Quote' button or contact our sales team directly at +91 9490701421 to receive a customized proforma invoice."
  },
  {
    category: "Orders & Wholesale",
    question: "Do you provide GST invoices for input tax credit?",
    answer: "Yes, we are a GST-registered company. A valid tax invoice with your business GSTIN will be provided with every order, allowing you to claim full input tax credit."
  },
  {
    category: "Cleaning & Care",
    question: "How often should I deep clean my commercial grill?",
    answer: "For high-volume commercial use, we recommend a daily wipe-down and a thorough deep clean once a week to maintain optimal hygiene and equipment longevity."
  },
  {
    category: "Fast & Cooking",
    question: "What is the maximum temperature the BBQ grill can reach?",
    answer: "Our heavy-duty commercial grills can reach sustained temperatures of up to 450°C (842°F), perfect for high-speed searing and traditional tandoor-style cooking."
